This is a React Native app that implements a simple todo list with features such as adding and deleting todos, marking todos as complete, and clearing all todos. The app uses AsyncStorage to persist the todos data on the user's device.

The app starts by defining some constants such as primary and white colors, followed by defining the App component. The App component uses the useState hook to define the todos state and the textInput state, which will hold the input text for adding new todos. Two useEffect hooks are used to load and save the todos data from AsyncStorage.

The component also defines several helper functions such as addTodo, saveTodoToUserDevice, getTodosFromUserDevice, markTodoComplete, deleteTodo, and clearAllTodos, which are used to add new todos, save and load todos data from AsyncStorage, mark a todo as complete, delete a todo, and clear all todos respectively.

The component also defines a ListItem component, which is used to render each todo item in the FlatList component.

Finally, the component returns the main layout of the app, which includes a header with the app title and a delete button, a FlatList component to display the todos, and a footer with an input field to add new todos and a button to submit the new todo.


------------HOW TO START THE PROJECT------------

open terminal 

Command 1 : npm uninstall -g react-native-cli @react-native-community/cli
command 2 : npx react-native@latest init ProjectName
command 3 : now open the same project in vs code then open new terminal in vs code then run command: npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

what is Async-storage :- AsyncStorage is a data storage system in React Native that is unencrypted, asynchronous, and allows users to persist data offline in React Native apps. This allows you to use and access the data from any React Native component and increases the app’s performance and experience since storing and retrieving data from the AsyncStorage does not affect the other codes from running.

AsyncStorage accepts and stores only string data, so we must always serialize the data before storing it if it is not a string. This means that we must first convert it to string data before storing it; here, the key and the value are both strings.

To convert the object we want to save to a string, we use JSON.stringify(). In situations where we get data back from the storage, we use the JSON.parse() to convert back to object:

After that, you can import it inside any of the React Native’s components that you want to use. Simply import it from the module and then call any of the methods:

// React Native component

import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

------FOR COMMAND 4:-------

To import the Icon component from react-native-vector-icons/MaterialIcons in a React Native CLI project, you can follow these steps:
Install the react-native-vector-icons library using npm or yarn. Run either of these commands in your project's root directory:
       
       npm install react-native-vector-icons
Link the library to your project by running the following command:
      react-native link react-native-vector-icons
      
This will add the necessary files and configurations to your project.
Now, you can import the Icon component from the MaterialIcons set in any of your React Native components using the following code:

import Icon from 'react-native-vector-icons/MaterialIcons';

You can then use the Icon component in your code as shown in the previous example I provided.
Keep in mind that if you're using a different set of icons, you should replace MaterialIcons in the import statement with the name of the icon set you want to use.


Command 5 : npx react-native start
Command 6 : npx react-native run-android
Command 7 : npx react-native run-ios
